## 1. Acceptance of Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Maxxd mobile application and related services (collectively, the "App" or "Service").

By downloading, installing, creating an account, or using the App, you:

- Acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms  
- Agree to be bound by them, and  
- Represent that you are legally able to enter into this agreement  

If you are using the App on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind that entity, and "you" refers to that entity.

## 2. Description of the Service

Maxxd is a consumer fitness and nutrition app that provides:

- AI-assisted food recognition and calorie estimation using images from your camera or photos you upload  
- Workout planning, exercise tracking, and related training content  
- Personalized recommendations based on your inputs, goals, and usage patterns  

Our AI-powered features are broadly similar in function to other apps in this space (for example, food scanning and estimation features like those found in apps such as Hava and CalAI, and workout or training features similar in concept to apps such as Ladder and Smart Gym). Maxxd is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any of those apps or companies.

Features may change over time, and we may introduce new features, modify existing features, or discontinue features at our discretion.

## 3. Eligibility

You may use the App only if:

- You are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), and  
- You are not barred from using the App under applicable law  

The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly permit children under 13 to use the App.

## 4. Health, Fitness, and Medical Disclaimers

Maxxd is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The content and recommendations in the App (including calorie estimates, workout plans, and other suggestions) are for informational and educational purposes only.

- Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you read or see in the App.

Maxxd uses AI and computer vision models to analyze images you capture with your camera or upload from your device to estimate the nutritional content of food ("AI Scanning Features").

By using these features, you acknowledge and agree that:

- **User responsibility.** You are solely responsible for evaluating the accuracy of information provided and for your own dietary choices  
- **No guarantee.** We do not warrant that any AI-generated or other information will be accurate, complete, or suitable for your particular needs  

You must not rely on Maxxd as the sole or primary source of nutritional information, particularly if you have medical conditions, allergies, or dietary restrictions.

## 20. Governing Law; Arbitration; Class Action Waiver

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles, except where local law provides you with non-waivable consumer rights.

### 20.1 Binding Arbitration

To the fullest extent permitted by law, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the App will be resolved solely by binding arbitration administered by a recognized arbitration provider, conducted in English, and held in San Diego County, California, unless otherwise required by law.

You and Wave State agree that:

- The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this arbitration provision  
- Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction  

Nothing in this Section prevents you from bringing issues to the attention of government agencies or regulators where applicable law so provides.

### 20.2 Class Action Waiver

To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Wave State agree that:

- All disputes will be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class, collective, or representative action  
- You may bring claims only in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding  

If this class action waiver is found unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then that claim or request may be brought only in court and not in arbitration.

Some users (for example certain EEA/UK consumers) may have non-waivable rights under local law to bring disputes in their local courts.

## 21. Changes to the App or Terms

We may modify the App or these Terms at any time.

If we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example, by updating the Effective Date, sending an in-app notice, or via email, where appropriate).

Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
